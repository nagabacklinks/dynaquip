What Are Butterfly Valves?

A butterfly valve is a quarter-turn rotational motion valve that is used to start, stop, or regulate fluid flow. It consists of a circular disc or plate that pivots on a central axis within a pipe or duct to control flow. This design offers quick operation and requires less space compared to other valve types.
